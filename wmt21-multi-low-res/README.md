# WMT21 Preprocessing Script

### Requirements

- requirements.txt: contains the necessary python libraries for the execution of scripts.
- scripts (folder): folder containing the scripts used to setup the preprocessing steps.

### Execution 

The main scripts is run.sh. It receives either a lang pair (e.g. ca-oc) or 'all'.
From this lang pair, the scripts will download the necessary data and start processing it accordingly.


```
scripts/run.sh ca-oc
```
